# DevOps Assignment 
Thank you for showing interest in becoming part of Verity Engineering.

The intention of this assignment is to showcase your skills and also to form a good base discussion after the deliverables are submitted.

As an Engineering team we believe that it's for the mutual benefit of both the team and the candidate to get a good taste of one another's way of work and thinking. This assignment is designed to serve this purpose as best as possible.

## Description

**Horme** - name inspired from the ancient Greek dog Horme best known for his eagrness. 

It is a tiny web server implementing a simple health check

Your goal is to package this application in such a way so that it can be easily deployed in the Cloud


### Requirements 

* Deployment should be packaged in such a way so that is fully compatible with a modern CI/CD tool e.g. ArgoCD,Flux,GitLab,Jenkins,Harness,Spinnaker

* Zero downtime during deployment

* Ability to rollback if needed

* Automated recovery in case of failure


#### Environment 

* Node 8+


## Deliverable 

To make things easier we believe that the deployment should be co-located with the rest of the app code.
